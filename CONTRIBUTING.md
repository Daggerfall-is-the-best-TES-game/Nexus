If you want to contribute, go ahead and make a fork. Once you do that, code your changes, and make a pull request. The standard.
When you perform your pull request, make sure that it is extremely detailed and legible. Also, feel free to complete any of the TODOs that are scattered throughout the code. Might be a little hard to find them, though. They're like easter eggs! :D

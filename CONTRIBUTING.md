If you want to contribute, go ahead and make a fork. Once you do that, code your changes, and make a pull request. The standard.

When you perform your pull request, it doesn't neccesarily have to be a long commit, only to sum up the changes. If you have a feeling that your code is going to be unneccesarily going to be bug prone, I advise to go in - depth on the changes.

Also, feel free to complete any of the TODOs that are scattered throughout the code. Might be a little hard to find them, though. They're like easter eggs! :D

**Pull Requests**
When you perform your pull request, it doesn't neccesarily have to be a long commit, only to sum up the changes. If you have a feeling that your code is going to be unneccesarily going to be bug prone, make sure it is in - depth.

**The JavaDoc**
Same method of contribution, just make sure that the style stays consistent with the rest of the previously created JavaDoc.

Also, feel free to complete any of the TODOs that are scattered throughout the code. Might be a little hard to find them, though. They're like easter eggs! :D

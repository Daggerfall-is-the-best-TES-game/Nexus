# Nexus
**Nexus** is programming, 3D modelling, and music production software.

**Goals**: 
1. An application that can work with multiple editor types, for example, a DAW, IDE, et cetera, and have that functionality in real-time.
2. In-real time code testing.
3. Immediate push to production, no middleman.

**Current Projects**:
* 1.0 - All basic, fundamental, features requested that will be implemented before release 1.0. Once the project implements all the features, then Phase 2 will begin with bug fixes, etc. 
* Music - This is a long term project to implement music editing.

**Contributing**:
If you want to contribute, please read the code of conduct and contributing documents. Also, take a look at the wiki for developer information on the structure of the project.

There is also a project website if you want to contribute to that as well.

# Nexus
**Nexus** is programming, 3D modelling, and music production software.

**Goals**: 
1. An application that can work with multiple editor types, for example, a DAW, IDE, et cetera, and have that functionality in real-time.
2. In-real time code testing.
3. Immediate push to production, no middleman.

**Current Projects**:
* Features - All basic, fundamental, features requested that will be implemented before the next release.
* Bugs - Any sizable bugs worth mentioning.

**Contributing**:
If you want to contribute, please read the code of conduct and contributing documents. Also, take a look at the wiki for developer information on the structure of the project. Any IDE that supports Gradle will work.

**Website**:
There is also a project website if you want to contribute to that as well. 
The JavaDoc is also located on the website.
